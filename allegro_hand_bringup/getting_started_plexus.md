# Allegro Hand Plexus User Guide

## Features

* **ROS 2 Control Integration**: A `ros2_control` `SystemInterface` for the Allegro Hand Plexus, enabling seamless integration with the ROS 2 ecosystem.
* **Hybrid Control Mode**: Supports a unique `position_effort_controller` that accepts both `position` and `effort` commands simultaneously on different topics.
* **Versatile Controller**: Comes with one primary pre-configured controller:
    * **`Position-Effort Controller`**: For direct, real-time joint control via either position or effort (torque) commands. This is ideal for advanced applications requiring dynamic switching between position and force control.
* **Full System Launch**: A single launch file brings up the robot driver, controller, robot state publisher, and RViz for visualization.

## Installation

1.  **Clone all required packages into your workspace:**
    ```bash
    # (Assuming your workspace is at ~/ros2_ws/src)
    cd ~/ros2_ws/src
    # git clone ... (clone this package and all other allegro_hand ROS 2 packages)
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ~/ros2_ws
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
    ```

3.  **Build the packages:**
    ```bash
    cd ~/ros2_ws
    colcon build
    ```

4.  **Source the environment:**
    ```bash
    source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
    ```

## Quick Start Guide

This guide walks through launching the Allegro Hand Plexus driver and testing its control modes.

### 1. Prerequisites: Activate CAN Interface

Before launching, ensure your CAN device is configured and active. The system is configured to use `can0` at a bitrate of `1000000`.

```bash
sudo ip link set can0 down
sudo ip link set can0 type can bitrate 1000000
sudo ip link set can0 up
```

> **NOTE**      
> If you are using dual hands, you must also activate `can1`.
> This example maps the CAN devices as follows:         
> - can0 : right hand     
> - can1 : left hand     


### 2. Launch the System

Launch the main bringup file for the Plexus hand. This will start the `ros2_control` node, load the `allegro_hand_position_effort_controller`, and open RViz.

#### Single Hand 

```bash
ros2 launch allegro_hand_bringup allegro_hand_plexus.launch.py
```

##### Options 

* `hand`:  
    - `left`: left hand 
    - `right`: right hand (default)
* `ros2_control_hardware_type`: 
    - `mock_components`: Use a simulated hardware interface for testing without a physical device.
    - `physical_device`: Use the real hardware interface. (default)

```bash
# Launch with a mock hardware interface
ros2 launch allegro_hand_bringup allegro_hand_plexus.launch.py ros2_control_hardware_type:=mock_components

# Launch the left hand
ros2 launch allegro_hand_bringup allegro_hand_plexus.launch.py hand:=left
```

#### Dual Hand 

```bash
ros2 launch allegro_hand_bringup allegro_hand_plexus_duo.launch.py
```

#### State Topics 

* `/joint_states`: Publishes the position, velocity, and effort of all joints.

#### Check Controllers 

You can check the status of the controllers in a new terminal:
```bash
ros2 control list_controllers
```

### 3. Test with Position-Effort Controller

The `allegro_hand_position_effort_controller` is active by default. You can send commands to two different topics to control the hand.

#### 3.1. Position Control

Send a command to the `~/commands` topic to move all joints to a position of `0.5` radians.

```bash
ros2 topic pub /allegro_hand_position_effort_controller/commands std_msgs/msg/Float64MultiArray "layout:
  dim:
  - label: ''
    size: 16
    stride: 1
  data_offset: 0
data: [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]"
```

#### 3.2. Effort (Torque) Control

Send a command to the `~/commands_effort` topic to apply `0.1` Nm of torque to all joints.

```bash
ros2 topic pub /allegro_hand_position_effort_controller/commands_effort std_msgs/msg/Float64MultiArray "layout:
  dim:
  - label: ''
    size: 16
    stride: 1
  data_offset: 0
data: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]"
```

## Hardware Interface Details

This document provides detailed information on the `allegro_hand_plexus_hardware` package, which serves as the `ros2_control` hardware interface for the Allegro Hand Plexus. It covers key features and parameter configuration. (link)
